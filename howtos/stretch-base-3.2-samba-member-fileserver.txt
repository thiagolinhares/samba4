Part 3.2 The "Samba MEMBER" (FILE-SERVER) server setup.
( Tested on Debian Stretch, samba 4.5.8 )

Now for an Samba member server, we need the following. 
- Correct hostname and resolving ( see part-1-checkup )
- Correct time for the server and network 
- Internet

Now we install the following, and this setups the following. 

Samba (member) 
Time server (client)

# the needed packages
#apt-get install samba winbind   	# For samba with Samba internal DNS
# Or
# apt-get install samba winbind bind9 # For samba with Bind BIND9_DLZ DNS 
#
# I noticed attr is selected but not acl for the install, 
# so to make sure these are installed. 
#apt-get install attr acl 
#
# if you want to ssh and/or have uid/gid resolving 
# ( adviced is yes, pleas install this. )
#apt-get install libnss-winbind libpam-winbind
#
# tools  ( optional, but very handy to have them installed )
#apt-get install bind9utils ldb-tools 

# python-gpgme is added when you install a samba 4.6.x+ 

# smbclient is added also for the tests later on.

# Now all in one go. 
apt-get install samba winbind acl libnss-winbind libpam-winbind \
 ntp krb5-user bind9utils ldb-tools smbclient -y

#### For the questions .. 
# Configuring Kerberos Authentication 
### You kan keep the default ( DNS domain in caps ). (INTERNAL.EXAMPLE.COM)
### Just keep in mind DNS domain != REALM

### Empty is ok, just hit enter

Now its getting interesting and first we disble the things we dont need. 

lets stop all services first we are going to configure. 
systemctl stop samba smbd nmbd winbind samba-ad-dc ntp

# See the status of the services: 
systemctl status samba smbd nmbd winbind samba-ad-dc ntp

# disable the "AD DC server startups"
systemctl mask samba samba-ad-dc
systemctl disable  samba samba-ad-dc

# set samba-ad-dc ready to start, but DONT start it yet. 
systemctl unmask smbd nmbd winbind
systemctl enable smbd nmbd winbind
systemctl stop smbd nmbd winbind

### NTP Begin ( Part 1/2 )
cp /etc/ntp.conf{,.org-debian}

# Now first setup the time server and make sure time is correct,
# before we do something with samba.
#
# Disable the pool servers. 
sed -i 's/pool 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst/#pool 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst/g' /etc/ntp.conf

sed -i 's/pool 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst/#pool 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst/g' /etc/ntp.conf

# For the Member server we point to the DC (1 or 2 or 3).
# change YOUR_DC_NAME_OR_IP to the hostname of ip adres of your DC.
sed -i 's/#server ntp.your-provider.example/server YOUR_DC_NAME_OR_IP/g' /etc/ntp.conf

cat << EOF >> /etc/ntp.conf
#
# Optional, define which interface ntp could/should use.
# Since SystemD, we dont have Predictable interface names anymore. 
# Info: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/
# run : ip a and check you interface name and change it. ( default = eth0 )
# Enable/disable what you want, its here as example for you.
# Notice: if you run : ntpq -p or ntpstat  ( apt-get install ntpstat )
# and you keep getting unsync messages, try disable-ing all the interface lines first and restart ntp
# If ntp tries to connect to ipv6 and its disabled, it wont sync. 
# test: systemctl stop ntp && strace ntpq -pn ::1|& grep -i conn
#interface listen lo
#interface listen eth0
#interface ignore wildcard
#interface ignore ipv6
#
EOF
systemctl restart ntp 
# and see if everything is running 
systemctl status ntp
